# Http4k Playground

This repository is used as a playground to experiment with [http4k](https://www.http4k.org/) and Test-Driven Development.

## Documentation

The [JourneyTests](./src/test/kotlin/com/example/JourneyTests.kt) uses the [TracerBullet](https://www.http4k.org/guide/reference/tracerbullet/) module
from [http4k](https://www.http4k.org/) in order to generate sequence and interaction diagrams of the core journeys.

The diagrams can be found in [here](./docs/system/generated)
